    detail: "Factory Data (FD) is responsible for delivering advanced analytics, strategic insights, infrastructure as code, and algorithms to support our factory. FD integrates Machine Learning and Data Science into our manufacturing facilities, providing a competitive edge. <br><br><b>Key Projects</b> <br><br>(2023): I led the efforts to migrate from Terraform to Terragrunt to ensure all our Infrastructure as Code would scale with ease. We currently only have 1 factory, but with this setup we have the infrastructure to scale globally. <br><br>(2022): As the dedicated DevOps Engineer supporting the new Drive Unit Shop, known as Enduro, I ensured that all new stations were seamlessly connected to our networks, enabling data to flow into our Manufacturing Data Warehouse from day one. This included creating custom deployments in Kubernetes to support moving large data from Kistler Servo Presses and Vision stations. I also assisted with deploying LineConfig, an internal tool used to setup every station (used by MFG Engineers to configure Enduro stations). <br><br>(2022): I built Snowgate & SnowFTP, internal programs that stream data directly into Snowflake from various sources like NATS clusters (messaging system similar to Kafka), AWS Kinesis, and ML applications like Petra-AI into our data warehouse. <br><br>(2021): I served as the key developer for the FD-Filesync project, aimed at moving images and video files out of the factory floor into our data warehouse. FD-Filesync moves more than 336 terabytes a year. This program is used factory wide and is leveraged heavily in the following shops: Battery, Body, Drive Unit, End of Line, and General Assembly. <br><br>(2021): Responsible for building and maintaining the Manufacturing EKS clusters, which power internal applications used across the factory. <br><br><b>Skills/Software</b><br><br>Terraform, Terragrunt, AWS, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL, ETL Pipelines, Fivetran, Gitlab CI/CD, Kubeflow, Git, Python, MLflow, Kubeflow, ZenML, Snowflake, and more."

    detail: "During my tenure at Rakuten, I served as a DevOps Engineer, bridging the gap between the DevOps and Data Science teams. My role primarily involved managing the development, staging, and production environments for the Rakuten Catalog Platform team. My core responsibilities encompassed a wide range of tasks, including system configurations, application lifecycles, infrastructure deployments, and the continuous development of internal tools designed for security audits. <br><br>At that time, I had the responsibility of overseeing 60 Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters of varying sizes. I was directly accountable for clusters used for training machine learning models and clusters housing Elasticsearch databases which fed data to over 1 million jobs per day.<br><br>Beyond my routine DevOps work, I led several significant efforts during my time at Rakuten. I orchestrated a major network migration that impacted all existing workloads, facilitating the transition to a service mesh architecture by moving to an Istio Service Mesh. Additionally, I collaborated closely with several Google Cloud engineers to test and debug Alpha programs, with one of the most notable being the A100 NVIDIA GPU program. We were the first Google Cloud customers to use A100 in GKE. I also played a key role in guiding my Data Science team towards adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC).<br><br>Lastly, I successfully facilitated the deployment of Kubeflow into production by implementing private clusters, utilizing Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and integrating CloudSQL. This architecture enabled future upgrades to be performed smoothly and securely, eliminating the risk of data loss."
